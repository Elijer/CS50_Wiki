### Vector3 Data Type
**Vector3.magnitude**
I think this takes two points and tells you how far away you are? Check the docs.

**Vector3.Dot(Vector A, Vector B**

**Vector3.Cross(Vector A, Vector B**

### Worldspace vs. Local space

### 'Transform' data type
['Position, rotation and scale of an object.'](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html)

Every object in a scene has a transform.
